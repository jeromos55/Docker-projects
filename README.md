# Docker-projects

Archive and create docker projects

I created this repository because I found this youtube video [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFgJkfScVNU) and I want to make notes from it and I created a documentation. If I need to create a similar project later, I can do it easier and faster. This video taught me a new way to use docker.

1. [Hello-docker project](hello-docker/README.md)
2. [React-docker project](react-docker/README.Docker.md)
3. Vite-docker project
4. mern-docker project
5. next-docker project
